# Using_Python2
This is the repository for the project to give marketing more insight on what data they have. In order to answer their questions we have compiled several python files to fulfill their needs. In order to answer the first question, you need to download the repository and first run the Requests each day.py file. The output will give a record of how many requests happened each day of the log. Next you need to run the split by month.py file. This file outputs and calculates the average requests per month and per week. It also splits the large log file into several smaller log files categorized by requests per month. The next file to run is the Python Code.py file which calculates the percentage of requests that were not successful and the percentage that were redirected elsewhere. Finally, you need to run most-and-least-requested.py to get the output of the file that was most and least requested in the log history.
